We give an example for a concrete three dimensional numerical implementation. The main result of the simulations is that this approach allows for the first time to evolve through a brief period of the merger phase of the black hole inspiral.},

	abstract = {Two well studied dwarf galaxies – NGC 3109 and NGC 6822 – present some of the strongest observational support for a ﬂat core at the center of galactic dark matter (DM) halos. We use detailed cosmologically motivated numerical models to investigate the systematics and the accuracy of recovering parameters of the galaxies. Some of our models match the observed structure of the two galaxies remarkably well. Our analysis shows that the rotation curves of these two galaxies are instead quite compatible with their DM halos having steep cuspy density proﬁles. The rotation curves in our models are measured using standard observational techniques, projecting velocities along the line of sight of an artiﬁcial observer and performing a tilted ring analysis. The models reproduce the rotation curves of both galaxies, the disk surface brightness proﬁles as well as the proﬁle of isophotal ellipticity and position angle. The models are centrally dominated by baryons; however, the dark matter component is globally dominant. The simulated disk mass is marginally consistent with a stellar mass-to-light ratio in agreement with the observed colors and the detected gaseous mass. We show that non-circular motions combined with gas pressure support and projection eﬀects results in a large underestimation of the circular velocity in the central ∼ 1 kpc region, creating the illusion of a constant density core. Although the systematic eﬀects mentioned above are stronger in barred systems, they are also present in axisymetric disks. Our results strongly suggest that there is no contradiction between the observed rotation curves in dwarf galaxies and the cuspy central dark matter density proﬁles predicted by Cold Dark Matter models.},

Here big structures form like in the LCDM model, by hierarchy, thus all the predictions of the LCDM model at big scales are reproduced by SFDM. This model predicts that all galaxies must be very similar and exist for bigger redshifts than in the LCDM model. In this work we show that BEC dark matter haloes ﬁt high-resolution rotation curves of a sample of thirteen low surface brightness galaxies. We compare our ﬁts to those obtained using a Navarro-Frenk-White and Pseudo-Isothermal (PI) proﬁles and found a better agreement with the SFDM and PI proﬁles. The mean value of the logarithmic inner density slopes is α = −0.27 ± 0.18. As a second result we ﬁnd a natural way to deﬁne the core radius with the advantage of being model-independent. Using this new deﬁnition in the BEC density proﬁle we ﬁnd that the recent observation of the constant dark matter central surface density can be reproduced. We conclude that in light of the diﬃculties that the standard model is currently facing the SFDM model can be a worthy alternative to keep exploring further.},

	abstract = {Dwarf spiral galaxies - and in particular the prototypical DDO 154 - are known to be completely dominated by an unseen component. The putative neutralinos - so far the favored explanation for the astronomical dark matter - fail to reproduce the well measured rotation curves of those systems because these species tend to form a central cusp whose presence is not supported by observation. We have considered here a self-coupled charged scalar field as an alternative to neutralinos and investigated whether a Bose condensate of that field could account for the dark matter inside DDO 154 and more generally inside dwarf spirals. The size of the condensate turns out to be precisely determined by the scalar mass m and self-coupling lambda of the field. We find actually that for m{\textasciicircum}4 / lambda = 50 - 75 eV{\textasciicircum}4, the agreement with the measurements of the circular speed of DDO 154 is impressive whereas it lessens for larger systems. The cosmological behavior of the field is also found to be consistent - yet marginally - with the limits set by BBN on the effective number of neutrino families. We conclude that classical configurations of a scalar and self-coupled field provide a possible solution to the astronomical dark matter problem and we suggest further directions of research.},

After showing why the Lee-Weinberg limit (which usually forbids a Dark Matter mass below a few GeV’s) does not necessarily apply in the case of scalar particles, we discuss how light candidates ( mdm {\textless} O( GeV) ) can satisfy both the gamma ray and relic density constraints. We ﬁnd two possibilities. Either Dark Matter is coupled to heavy fermions (but if mdm {\textless}∼ 100 MeV, an asymmetry between the Dark Matter particle and antiparticle number densities is likely to be required), or Dark Matter is coupled to a new light gauge boson U . The (collisional) damping of light candidates is, in some circumstances, large enough to be mentioned, but in most cases too small to generate a non linear matter power spectrum at the present epoch that diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the Cold Dark Matter spectrum. On the other hand, heavier scalar Dark Matter particles (i.e. with mdm {\textgreater}∼ O( GeV)) turn out to be much less constrained. We ﬁnally discuss a theoretical framework for scalar candidates, inspired from theories with N = 2 extended supersymmetry and/or extra space dimensions, in which the Dark Matter stability results from a new discrete (or continuous) symmetry.},

	abstract = {Scalar ﬁelds endowed with a cosh potential behave in the linear regime, exactly as the cold dark matter (CDM) model. Thus, the scalar ﬁeld dark matter (SFDM) hypothesis predicts the same structure formation as the CDM model. This means that CDM and SFDM are equivalent from the cosmological point of view. The free parameters of the SFDM model are determined by cosmological observations. In previous work we showed that if we use such parameters, the scalar ﬁeld collapses forming stable objects with a mass around 1012M . In the present work we use analytical solutions of the ﬂat and weak ﬁeld limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations and show that the SFDM density proﬁle corresponds to a halo with an almost ﬂat central density and that it coincides with the CDM model in a broad outer region. This result could solve the problem of the density cusp DM halo in galaxies without any additional hypothesis, thus supporting the viability of the SFDM model.},
